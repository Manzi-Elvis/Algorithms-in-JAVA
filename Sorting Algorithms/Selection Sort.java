/*
 * 
 * Description:
 * Selection Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that divides the array 
 * into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. 
 * It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part 
 * and moves it to the end of the sorted part.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Useful when memory is limited since it performs sorting in-place.
 * - Great for small datasets where simplicity is preferred over performance.
 * - Often used in educational settings to teach sorting logic and selection techniques.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n²)
 * - Average Case: O(n²)
 * - Worst Case: O(n²)
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1) → in-place sorting, requires no extra memory.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * 1. Loop through the array.
 * 2. On each iteration, assume the current index is the smallest.
 * 3. Compare it with every element to the right to find the true smallest value.
 * 4. Swap the smallest value with the current index.
 * 5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
