/*
 * BubbleSort.java
 * 
 * Description:
 * Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It repeatedly compares
 * adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process
 * continues until the array is completely sorted.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - When you need a simple sorting algorithm for small datasets.
 * - Good for educational purposes to understand the concept of comparisons and swaps.
 * - Not ideal for large datasets (inefficient compared to more advanced algorithms).
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n)  → when the array is already sorted.
 * - Average Case: O(n²)
 * - Worst Case: O(n²)
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1) → in-place sorting (no extra memory used)
 * 
 * Approach:
 * 1. Loop through the array multiple times.
 * 2. On each pass, compare adjacent elements.
 * 3. If one element is larger than the next, swap them.
 * 4. With every pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.
 * 5. Repeat until no swaps are needed (the array is sorted).
